       <td valign="top"><h2>Supervisors</h2>
         <p>Any position that gives incumbents special  privileges or elevated access to systems or data should be considered  to require this designation, including most information technology positions. Special or elevated access is generally available to systems administrators for the purpose of administering others' access to systems. They also often have access to data above that of general  users. The <a href="https://security.utexas.edu">Information Security Office</a> can provide additional guidance to supervisors in determining an appropriate  designation.</p>
         <h2>Employees</h2>
         <p>Employees  are expected to familiarize themselves with all policies, rules, and  regulations that pertain to their job. Additionally, as a condition of  employment, employees who occupy a <em>Position of  Special Trust</em> are expected to acknowledge those additional  responsibilities.</p></td>
